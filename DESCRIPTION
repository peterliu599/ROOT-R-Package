Description: ROOT (Rashomon set of Optimal Trees) is a general framework for globally
  optimizing user-specified functionals over interpretable binary weight functions represented
  as sparse decision trees. It searches over many candidate trees to construct a Rashomon
  set of near-optimal solutions and derives a characteristic summary tree that highlights
  stable patterns in the optimized weights. The current implementation focuses on generalizability
  and transportability problems. Given trial and target data, ROOT learns weighting rules that
  optimize target treatment-effect estimators and helps identify subpopulations that are underrepresented
  or contribute disproportionately to the variance of the target treatment-effect estimate.
