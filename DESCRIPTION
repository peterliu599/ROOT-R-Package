Description: ROOT (Rashomon set of Optimal Trees) is a general framework for globally optimizing user-specified functionals over interpretable binary weight functions represented as sparse decision trees. It searches over many candidate trees to construct a Rashomon set of near-optimal solutions and derives a characteristic summary tree that highlights stable patterns in the optimized weights.
