Description: ROOT (Rashomon set of Optimal Trees) is a framework for learning 
  interpretable binary weight functions represented as sparse decision trees. 
  It constructs a Rashomon set of near-optimal trees and extracts a 
  characteristic tree to summarize patterns. Given trial and target data, the 
  package identifies trial subpopulations that contribute disproportionately to 
  the variance of the target treatment-effect estimate (underrepresented groups).
