# Overview

**ROOT (Rashomon set of Optimal Trees)** is a **general functional optimization framework** for learning interpretable binary weight functions, represented as sparse decision trees.  

At its core, ROOT searches over functions \( w(X) \in \{0,1\} \) that assign inclusion or exclusion weights to units based on their covariates \( X \). The optimization objective (or **loss function**) can be chosen to reflect different scientific goals.  

- **Framework flexibility:** By substituting different loss functions, ROOT can be applied to diverse settings.
- **Interpretability:** Solutions are restricted to sparse decision trees, ensuring outputs are human-readable and suitable for communication with collaborators.  
- **Rashomon principle:** Rather than return a single solution, ROOT identifies a **Rashomon set** of near-optimal trees, highlighting multiple plausible explanations. A **characteristic tree** can then be extracted to summarize common patterns.

## ROOT for generalizability

The original ROOT paper demonstrates this framework in the context of **generalizing causal effects from randomized trials to a target population**.  

- **Problem:** Randomized trials are internally valid but often differ from the target population. If trial participants underrepresent certain effect-modifying subgroups, estimates of the **Target Average Treatment Effect (TATE)** can be imprecise or misleading.  
- **Solution:** ROOT introduces a refined estimand, the **Weighted Target Average Treatment Effect (WTATE)**, defined over the subset of the population that is sufficiently represented.  
  - Units are either included (\( w(X) = 1 \)) or excluded (\( w(X) = 0 \)) according to learned tree-structured rules.  
  - The loss function is designed to minimize the variance of the estimator while retaining as much of the target population as possible.  
- **Interpretation:** ROOT’s decision trees explicitly describe *who is underrepresented* and *why they are excluded*. The Rashomon set provides multiple, equally valid ways of describing these subgroups.
