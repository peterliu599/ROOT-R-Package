## What is ROOT?

**ROOT** (Rashomon Optimized Objective Trees) solves a specific optimization problem:

> **Find an interpretable, tree-based weight function w(x) ∈ {0,1} that minimizes a global objective L(w, D)**

In plain terms: ROOT selects a subset of your data (w=1 means "keep", w=0 means "drop") that optimizes some criterion, while ensuring the selection rule is **interpretable** as a simple decision tree.
