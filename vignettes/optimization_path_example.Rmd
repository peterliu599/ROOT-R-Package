## Introduction

While ROOT was designed for treatment effect generalizability, its core algorithm is a **general-purpose optimizer** for finding interpretable binary weight functions. This vignette demonstrates using ROOT with a custom objective function.

**The general ROOT problem:**

> Given data D and a loss function L(w, D), find an interpretable tree-based weight function w(x) ∈ {0,1} that minimizes L.

This is useful whenever you need to:

- Select a subset of observations optimizing some criterion
- Find interpretable rules for inclusion/exclusion decisions
- Balance multiple objectives through a custom loss function
