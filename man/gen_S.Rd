\title{Generate sample indicator S drawn from a Bernoulli distribution}
\usage{
gen_S(X, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A \code{data.frame} of covariates that contains at least
\code{X0} and \code{X1}.}

\item{seed}{Optional \code{numeric(1)} seed. If \code{NULL} no seed is set.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one column \code{S} of values in \code{0}
or \code{1}.
}
\description{
Generates a binary sample inclusion indicator \code{S} for each observation,
using a logistic model influenced by a rectangular region in \code{X0} and
\code{X1}. In the ROOT generalizability path, \code{S = 1} is interpreted as
belonging to the trial sample and \code{S = 0} as belonging to the target
sample.
}
\details{
The inclusion probability is \eqn{p = plogis(a)} where
\eqn{a = 0.25 - 2 * I(X0 in (0.5,1) and X1 in (0.5,1))}.
